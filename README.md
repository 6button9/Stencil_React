Stencil_React

The React project is ment to run as a webpack project.

Set up your project as shown in turorial below on the Microsoft website and replace the src directory with the React/scr direcotoy and replace all the files in the project directory with the files in the React directory.

You need to run webpack form the project directory to produce the index.html file. Open the file to view the website or refresh the page if it is alreay open.

For the Stencil example start wiht the Git clone shown on the Stencil website. https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started

Then replace the src directory with the contents of the Stencil/src directory.

Once you run npm start the project will recopile on saving changes made to any of the project scr files. If the website is up is should refresh on recopiles, or check the terminal for compilation errors.

On my computer it is at localhost:3333

I can be contacted through my 6button9.wordpress.com blog.

The Stencil App is now out in frount of the React App by several components. For a couple of them, I want to finish cleaning up the user interface, before I convert them to React.
